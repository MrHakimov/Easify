This web-service replaces some words in the given text to make text much more easier to read and understand.

Imagine a situation - you are reading some literature and some words are really difficult, but you don't want to translate, you just want to understand the meaning. So, I am happy to say that this service (app) may help you!

I will not say that app works correct in all cases, but usually it will give you a good result :).

The idea of this web application is to make the understanding of English texts easier by replacing difficult words with synonyms using [Thesaurus.com API](http://thesaurus.altervista.org/thesaurus/v1) to fetch synonyms and a list of 100000 most popular English words to choose the most commonly used one.

**Stack:** _Spring Framework_, _Vue.js Framework_

You can read how am I going to improve this application [here](/TODO.md).
